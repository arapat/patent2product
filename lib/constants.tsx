        abstract: "An earphone cover for an earphone includes an ear bud skin and an extension. The earphone includes an ear bud with a stem, and the earphone is inserted into a user's ear canal. The stem extends from the ear bud and a primary speaker outlet is formed on the ear bud. The ear bud skin substantially covers the ear bud of the earphone and increases friction between the ear bud and user's ear (provides an interface that increases friction between the ear bud and the user's ear) and the extension extends from the ear bud skin for more secure fit of the earphone to user's ear. The earphone cover is sufficiently flexible and elastic to accept insertion of the earphone therein along with being made of a material to provide a comfortable fit too.",

The flange can be adhered to a surface of the area of reduced thickness in order to form a transparent protective cover for the display screen.",
